### Programming On Screen Keyboard

#### **Example of popup keyboard:**

----

### Easily **customisable** popup on screen keyboard;
- Add unique variables
- shortcuts
- Missing keys from your keyboard (difficult on my laptop to write a pipe or backslash symbols)
- Change background colour
- Change opacity
 
----

### **Convenient usage:**
- activate popup by pressing: Left CTRL + Left ALT *(Obviously easily changable to suit, but found personally it doesn't popup too often when not needed, and is quickly activated when programming)*
  
### **Popup auto disappears:**
- after you choose a selection
- after a few seconds
- just click - as it auto centers to exit button
